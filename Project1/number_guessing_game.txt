We will write a program that generates a random number
and asks the player to guess it. If the players guess is 
higher than the actual number, the program display "Lower 
number please". Similarly if the user guess is too low, 
the program prints "Higher number please" 
When the user guesses the correct number, the program 
displays the nubmer of guesses the player used to arrive
at the number.  
HINT : USE LOOPS , USE RANDOM NUMBERS
